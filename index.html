<h1>Overview: What is MMW?</h1>
	<p>
		Magic Mansion Worle (MMW) is a *deep breath* Map Building, Deck Building, Wizard Dueling, Puzzle Game! <br>
		It sounds more complicated than it is. The main rules will be intuitive because MMW is based on three games: <br>
		<ol>
			<li>Rock Paper Scissors (dueling system)</li>
			<li>Poker (betting system)</li>
			<li>Worldle (puzzle system)</li>
		</ol>
		First, let's get a handle on the big picture: <br>
		<dl>
			<dt>Overall Objective</dt><dd>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are gained by solving the puzzle, so the player who solves the puzzle the most times wins! (In the base game mode)</dd>
			<dt>Exploration and Resource Gathering</dt><dd>Players place down Map Tiles as they move around, building a unique map each game. Each room will have some Letters in it. Successfully Search rooms to gather letters and gain Spell Cards.</dd>
			<dt>Three Phases per Round</dt><dd>The game procedes in Rounds, with three phases per round: 
			<ol>
				<li>Movement Phase: All players select a Movement Card and reveal at the same time. Then all player tokens are moved accordingly.</li>
				<li>Action Phase: All players select an Action Card and reveal at the same time. There are three actions: Search, Duel, Puzzle. If two or more players are in the same room, and one player chooses to Duel, then everyone is drawn into the duel.</li>
				<li>Resolution Phase: Players resolve the actions they selected, either rolling to see what they find, attempting the puzzle, or entering into a Wizard Duel. Once all actions have been completed, the next round begins!</li>
			</ol></dd>
			<dt>Dueling</dt><dd>If you find yourself in the same room as another player, watch out for Wizard Duels! Wizards (you players) duel using the hand of spell cards build up and currated by exploring around the map. Each spell has a type (it's Rock Paper Scissors) and players will bet (like poker) on the outcome of the duel, using the letters you've collected from around the map.</dd>
			<dt>Puzzling</dt><dd>Once a player has enough letters that they think they can solve The Puzzle, they must make their way to (or find) the puzzle room. One in the puzzle room, the player's collection of letters can be used to attempt to solve a Christmas-themed Wordle. Each time a player enters the puzzle room, they five attempts at the puzzle. If they don't solve the puzzle, any correct letters remains in the puzzle, making it easier for the next person to solve. Get the right letters and guess the right word first to get points!</dd>
			<dt>Escallation</dt><dd>Each time someone solves the puzzle, the next puzzle gets harder by one letter and the Minimum Bet (for dueling) increase by one letter. The board tiles are also refreshed and NPCs may spawn.</dd>
		</dl>
<br><br>
	Okay, things are starting to get a little complicated and there are more than a few rules. But have no fear! Read through the following Example Gameplay to get a feel for how the game works.

<h1>Example Gameplay</h1>

<h2>Example 1: Basic Duel</h2>
<p>
	Up to this point in the game, Ron and Harry have travelled around the map a bit, built up a 'hand' of spell cards and collected some letters. During the Movement Phase of the current round, Ron and Harry end up moving into the same room.<br>
	During the Action Phase, Harry chooses to <i>Search</i> and Ron chooses to <i>Duel</i>. The duel action cancels any other actions in that room. At the start of the duel, the player's have:
	<ul>
		<li>Harry</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Spell Cards: <img src="/images/avis.png"/></li>
			<li>Letter: 6</li>
			<li>Current HP: 5</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Ron</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Spell Cards: **img1** **img2** **img3**</li>
			<li>Letter: 10</li>
			<li>Current HP: 6</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</p>
	
<table border = "1" style = "text-align: center">

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ron<br></td>
		<td>The Pot<br></td>
		<td>Harry<br></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ron<br></td>
		<td>The Pot<br></td>

	</tr>
</table>
	
<p>
	At this point in the game, the players have moved around a bit, expanded the map, collected a 'hand' of three Spell Cards, and gathered a few Letters. Top of the round!
</p>
	
<table border = "1", style = "text-align: center">
	<tr><td colspan="2">In the Movement Phase, both Harry and Ron reveal their Movement Cards. Harry selected 'Down' and Ron selected 'Up'. After they move their player token they find themselves in the same room.</td></tr>

	<tr><td>Harry</td><td>Ron<br> Neither Ron nor Harry choose to place a bet in the first round. Since Ron played Duel and Harry didn't, for the first round, Ron gains 'Control of Play' and will have to play their spell card first. Ron selects <i>Bombardo!</i>, which has the type 'Paper'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>In their hand of spell cards, Harry has two Paper-type spells and a Snip(scissor)-type spell.<br>Harry plays the Snip Spell to Dominate Ron's spell.<br>Harry plays <i>Avis!</i></td><td>Ron<br></td></tr>

	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since Harry was the last to bet, Harry gains Control of Play and must play their spell first.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>Thinking that Ron might only have paper spells, Harry chooses to play <i>Sectumsempra!</i> which is paper-type.</td><td>Ron<br>Dang. Ron does only have paper-type spells, so they can't Dominate Harry's spell.<br>
	Not wanting to reveal the rest of their hand, Ron plays <i>Bombardo!</i></td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since both spells are of the type Paper, Ron's spell Counter's Harry's.<br>

	<tr><td>Harry</td><td>Ron<br>Feeling confident, Ron bets another 2 letters this round. Ron only has 1 letter left!</td></tr>

	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since Ron folded, Harry wins the pot and the duel ends.<br>

	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since they were involved in a Duel, both Ron and Harry gain the Manditory Movement condition and must move to another room next Round.<br>

</table>

	<br>
	<p>
		Summary: Ron and Harry moved into the same room. Since Ron chose to Duel, Harry could not Search the room as they wanted. <br> 
		Both players placed the Minimum Bet of 1 letter into the pot. <br>
		Ron had Control of Play, so they played their spell card first. <br>
		Harry had a spell that Dominated (by the rules of Rock Paper Scissors) and chose to play that, dealing damage to Ron.<br>
		Harry then bet 2 letters on the next round, which Ron called.<br>
		Since Harry bet last, they gained Control of Play and played their card first.<br>
		Ron could only Counter, matching the type of Harry's spell. Since the spells had the same speed value, neither spell happened.<br>
		Ron then bet 2 letters on the next round, which Harry Raised to three, which would put Ron All In.<br>
		At this point Ron Folded, and Harry won the duel.
	</p>

<h2>Example 2: Three Player Duel</h2>

	<p>
		Prior to this scene, a number of rounds have already been played. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all have a collection of letters and are wanting to solve the puzzle. All three players move into the puzzle room. Hermione, being a huge nerd, chooses the Puzzle action. Harry, of course, needs Hermione's help to solve the puzzle, and also chooses the Puzzle action, hoping that they can solve the puzzle together. But Ron's wand is broken and needs to prove to themself that they can solve the puzzle on their own. Ron chooses Duel. All three players are drawn into a duel. <br>
		Here are the player stats at the top of the duel: <br>
		<ul>
			<caption>Harry</caption>
			<li>Health Points: 3</li>
			<li>Spell Cards: 1 paper-type, 1 Rock-type</li>
			<li>Letters: 10</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<caption>Ron</caption>
			<li>Health Points: 2</li>
			<li>Spell Cards: 2 Snip-type, 1 Rock-type</li>
			<li>Letters: 5</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<caption>Hermione</caption>
			<li>Health Points: 8</li>
			<li>Spell Cards: 1 Snip-type, 1 Rock-type, 1 Paper-type</li>
			<li>Letters: 15</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<table border = "1" style = "text-align: center">
		<tr><td>Harry<br>Places Minimum Bet of 1 letter</td><td>Ron<br>Places Minimum Bet</td><td>Hermione<br>Chooses to bet on the first round. Raises the Pot to 2 letter.</td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan = "3">Ron and Harry both Call Hermione's raise and add 1 more letter to the pot.<br>
		Ron was the only one who choose Duel, so Ron has Control of Play (despite Hermione being the last player to raise. This only applies to the first round).</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Harry<br></td><td>Ron<br>Has Control of Play and chooses <i>Riddikulus!</i> (Rock-type, converts any damage taken to healing)</td><td>Hermione<br></td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan = "3">Ron has Control of Play, so they are attacking and defending against both Harry and Hermione's spells.</td>
		<tr><td>Harry<br>Plays <i>Crucio!</i>(paper-type, deals 1d6 dmg)<br>Since this spell Dominates Ron's, only Harry's spell effect would happen  </td><td>Ron<br>  </td><td>Hermione<br>plays <i>Opugno!</i> (Rock-type, 1d6 damage)<br>Since this is of the same type as Ron's spell, Hermione's spell effect does not happen (Counter)</td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan = "3">Ron would have taken 1d6 damage (4) from Harry's Spell (nothing from Hermione's Counter) but Riddikulus's effect instead heals Ron for 4 HP.</td>
		<tr><td>Harry<br>  </td><td>Ron<br>  </td><td>Hermione<br> Having lots of letters to spare, Hermione bets 3 letters. </td></tr>
		<tr><td>Harry<br>Calls Hermione's bet, adds three letters  </td><td>Ron<br>Also calls, though this puts Ron All In  </td><td>Hermione<br>  </td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan = "3">Since Hermione bet last, they have Control of Play. Hermione is now attacking/defending against both Ron and Harry.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Harry<br>  </td><td>Ron<br>  </td><td>Hermione<br>Plays <i>Opugno</i> (Rock-type)  </td></tr>
		<tr><td>Harry<br> Plays <i>Crucio!</i> (Rock-type, 1d6 dmg) which Dominates Hermione's spell </td><td>Ron<br> Plays <i>Serpensortia</i> (Snip-type, 1d6 dmg). This spell is subordinate to Hermione's Rock-type so Ron will be hit by Hermione's spell</td><td>Hermione<br>  </td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan = "3">Hermione's Rock-type is dominated by Harry's Paper-type, so Hermione takes 1d6 damag (2). Ron's Snip-type spell is subordinate to Hermione's so Ron takes 1d6 (3) damage from Hermione.</td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan = "3">Ron was All In on that last round, but didn't end up winning. Ron is now forced to Fold.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Harry<br>Being low on health, Harry doesn't bet, not wanting Control of Play.</td><td>Ron<br> (Out of the duel) </td><td>Hermione<br>Also doesn't bet.</td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan = "3">Since no one bet that last round, no one has Control of Play.<br>
		In this case, both players flip their cards at the same time.</td></tr>
		<tr><td>Harry<br>Plays <i>Crucio!</i> (Rock-type, 1d6). </td><td>Ron<br> (out) </td><td>Hermione<br>Plays <i>Abruptio Placentae!</i> (Paper-type, 1d6) </td></tr>
		<tr><td colspan ="3">Harry's spell is dominated by Hermione's spell (paper beats rock). Harry takes 1d6 dmg and Hermione rolls a 6! Harry drops to 0HP.<br>
		Harry respawns back in the Ballroom, leaving all their remaining letters behind.<br>
		Hermione collects a huge pile of letter from winning the duel</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>At this point, if any spell had an Area Effect or Room Effect, the appropriate token would be added to the room.<br>
	On the next round, Hermione can then try the puzzle, unless Ron tries to attack again.<br>
		Harry died, but that's okay. The only consequence is loosing your letters (in the base game. There is an option to add lives for different game modes).

		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Dueling with Multiple Players and Teams</strong><br>
		<ol>
			<li>If any one player in a room chooses to duel, all players (and NPCs) in the room are drawn into a duel.</li>
			<li>Before placing their Minimum Bets, any number of players can choose to Team Up. Teams cannot be formed once the duel has started</li>
			<li>When on a team:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>All team members must place the Minumum Bet and Call all subsequent bets (including bets by their team member) to stay in the duel.</li>
					<li>All team members must play a spell card, but the team gets to then choose which spell to remain in play after seeing the other spells played.</li>
					<li>If any one member of a team takes damage, all members of the team must also take that damage. However, one team member can choose to take some or all of the damage that would have been taken by their comrade. (The team, as a collective, must take the full amount of damage).</li>
					<li>If one member of a team Dies, Folds, or is forced All In (and looses), the remaining team members may remain in the duel.</li>
					<li>If a team wins a duel, they can choose to divide the letters among the members as they please.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>When there are more than two players (or more than two teams) in a duel, all players reveal their spell cards at the same time. Once the teams have removed the spell card(s) they will not be using, the cards match up as follows:</li>
				<dl>
					<dt>All Counter</dt><dd>If all spells are the same, spell effects happen in order of speed. IF any two spells have the same speed, those spells do not happen. Spell damage is deal to all other players. Spell healing applies to all members of a team. Spell effects happen to all members of a team (one teleportation spells moves all members of the team).</dd>
					<dt>One Parry</dt><dd>If one spell dominates all the others, only that spell happens and affects all other players.</dd>
					<dt>Counter-Parry</dt><dd>If multiple spells are the dominant type and have different speeds, then only those spells happen and in order of their speeds.</dd>
					<dt>Counter-Cancel</dt><dd>If multiple spells are dominant, but have the same speed, then neither dominant spell happens and the remaining spells in play happen instead, according to the spell pairings.</dd>
				</dl>
			<li>Play continues until one of the end conditions is met.</li>
