<h1>Welcome to Magic Mansion Wordle! (Alpha Build)</h1>
<hr width = 50%>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Magic Mansion Wordle is a map-building, deck-building, puzzle game.<br>
That seems like a lot, but once we get the hang of it, it should be a lot of fun. <br>
<dl>
<caption>General Overview of Game Elements</caption>
    <dt>Map-building</dt><dd>Players place down map tiles as they move around and explore, building a new board every game!</dd>
    <dt>Deck-building</dt><dd>Find Spell Cards as you explore and use them to build the best hand. Test your hand against other players and NPC in thrilling duels!</dd>
    <dt>Puzzle Game</dt><dd>Gain points by solving a Wordle-style puzzle, using letters found around the map or won from duelling other players.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>
Set up:
<ol>
<li>Start by shuffling the Map Tiles and Spell Cards</li>
<li>Each player starts with four Movement Cards: Up, Down, Left Right.</li>
<li>Each player starts with one of each of the Action Cards: Search, Attack, Puzzle.</li>
<li>Place the Ballroom map tile in the center of the table and place all Player Tokens on top.</li>
<li>NPC Tokens do not start on the Map</li>
<li>Lastly, bring up the Wordle code on a computer and start running the program</li>
</ol>
<br>
Now the game is ready to play!<br>
The game progresses in Rounds. Each round has 3 phases:
<ol>
<li>Movement Phase</li>
<li>Action Phase</li>
<li>Resolution Phase</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dt>Movement Phase</dt>
    <dd>Each player selects on of their movement cards. When everyone is ready, place your cards down at the same time. This allows players to run away from each other or avoid being followed. NPCs always move randomly (see NPC Rules). <br> 
Player and NPC tokens are moved accordingly. If a player moves outside a map edge, they draw a map tile and place it down (doors connecting to doors).<br>
When a new tile is placed, roll 1d4 and add number of letters to that map tile. If a 4 is rolled, also place an NPC on that map tile.<br>
Note: NPCs cannot place down map tiles. If they choose a direction that would require a new tile, they instead do not move.
     </dd>
<dt>Action Phase</dt>
    <dd>Each player selects an Action card. When ready, everyone reveals their selection at the same time.<br>
Note: NPCs always choose to Attack if there is someone in the room. Otherwise they just gain 1 Letter upon entering a new room.
	</dd>
<dt>Resolution Phase</dt>
     <dd>Any action that only involves one player, like a Search action or a Puzzle action (see "Puzzle Action" for conditions) can be resolved immediately by the player. <br>
Actions involving two people (Attack or Puzzle (see condition)) are resolved according to the "Attack Rules"<br>
When all actions are resolved, progress to the next round and repeat.
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Rules for Attack</h3>
<p><pre>
When one or more player chooses to Duel, all players in the room are drawn into the Duel
	All players must anti up the Minimum Bet.
	Minimum Bet is the minimum number of letters a player must wager in a duel.
	Minimum Bet starts at 1 and increases by 1 every time someone Solves the Puzzle.
	All bets are placed in the center, letters facing down.
Before the first Draw, any player in the duel can choose to Raise
	To Raise, place a number of letters above the minimum bet in the pot
All other players can either:
	Call - match the raise number of letters in the pot
	Fold - turn tail and flee
		Must still offer up the Minimum Bet
If a player does not have enough letters to Call: They can Go All In
		A player who is All In is still in the duel and can still in the whole pot
	No split pots
If a player has no letters to meet the Minimum Bet:
	Can still duel as long as they have spells
	This player can still win the whole pot if they win the battle
If a player does not have any spell cards:
	They must still place the Minimum Bet (if they can).
	Will take the effect of one card played by their attacker, if attacker chooses to play
	Basically, you can attack the defenseless
	Cannot fold and run away if no one is the duel raised beyond the minimum bet
Draw! When all bets are placed, the duel begins!
	If only one player chose to Attack:
		Attacking player chooses a spell and plays it first
		Defending player can then choose a spell to try to PARRY 
			PARRYING a spell is based on SPELL TYPE
				Rock, paper, scissors.
				Example :If attacker plays a ROCK, defender can play a PAPER spell to PARRY
				PARRYING a spell negates the effect of the Attacking spell
				Effect of the Parry spell apply to the attacker
			COUNTER: 
				COUNTERING is also based only on SPELL TYPE
				Rock, paper, scissors
				Playing a spell of the SAME TYPE Counters that spell
				COUNTERING a spell negates the effect of both spells
				I.e. nothing happens
				Example: Attacker plays ROCK, defender plays ROCK
				After countering, both players select a SECOND CARD
	SECOND CARDs are always Drawn at the same time
		See Attacking at the Same Time below
Attacking at the Same Time:
	Two or more players all chose Attack action
	Each player selects a card from their hand and places face down in front of them
	Both cards are flipped (Drawn) at the same time
	The spell with the best SPEED happens first
		Lower numbers have higher SPEED
			Ex. Speed of 1 goes before speed of 2
	Target takes damage or applies effect as specified by the spell
	If the player with the SLOWER spell is still alive AND still able to attack:
	The slow spells effect then happens 
	Target takes damage or applies spell effect as specified by the spell
	If one player is reduced to zero HP, they are killed and respawn immediately in the Ballroom
	Loose the letters that they bet, but nothing else
	If both players are still alive and still in the same room and are still able to cast:
	Enter the next Round of Betting
	Subsequent Rounds of Betting/Combat:
		Both players pick up their played spell cards and return them to their hand
		Either player can either:
			Bet - any number of letters
			Call - meeting the other players bet
		Continue to next round of combat, both Attacking at the Same Time
Rounds continue until someone folds or dies
		Raise - Call and add a bet
		Fold - Player chooses to pull out of the fight
			They loose what they bet up to this point, but combat ends
			Opponent wins the letters that were bet
Finally, apply Area Effect to the room that resulted from any spells played
	Each type of effect can only be applied once

After resolving the Duel (attack action):
	Both players gain Mandatory Movement 
		Must play a movement card in the next Movement Phase

If in the puzzle room, forces both players Leave the Puzzle Room
	Clearing their inventory
Gives a reason to both Puzzle and then duel over the spoils, so at least someone gets something
