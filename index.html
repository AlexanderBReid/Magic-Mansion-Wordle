<h1>Overview: What is MMW?</h1>
	<p>
		Magic Mansion Worle (MMW) is a *deep breath* Map Building, Deck Building, Wizard Dueling, Puzzle Game! <br>
		It sounds more complicated than it is. The main rules will be intuitive because MMW is based on three games: <br>
		<ol>
			<li>Rock Paper Scissors (dueling system)</li>
			<li>Poker (betting system)</li>
			<li>Worldle (puzzle system)</li>
		</ol>
		First, let's get a handle on the big picture: <br>
		<dl>
			<dt>Overall Objective</dt><dd>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are gained by solving the puzzle, so the player who solves the puzzle the most times wins! (In the base game mode)</dd>
			<dt>Exploration and Resource Gathering</dt><dd>Players place down Map Tiles as they move around, building a unique map each game. Each room will have some Letters in it. Successfully Search rooms to gather letters and gain Spell Cards.</dd>
			<dt>Three Phases per Round</dt><dd>The game procedes in Rounds, with three phases per round: 
			<ol>
				<li>Movement Phase: All players select a Movement Card and reveal at the same time. Then all player tokens are moved accordingly.</li>
				<li>Action Phase: All players select an Action Card and reveal at the same time. There are three actions: Search, Duel, Puzzle. If two or more players are in the same room, and one player chooses to Duel, then everyone is drawn into the duel.</li>
				<li>Resolution Phase: Players resolve the actions they selected, either rolling to see what they find, attempting the puzzle, or entering into a Wizard Duel. Once all actions have been completed, the next round begins!</li>
			</ol></dd>
			<dt>Dueling</dt><dd>If you find yourself in the same room as another player, watch out for Wizard Duels! Wizards (you players) duel using the hand of spell cards build up and currated by exploring around the map. Each spell has a type (it's Rock Paper Scissors) and players will bet (like poker) on the outcome of the duel, using the letters you've collected from around the map.</dd>
			<dt>Puzzling</dt><dd>Once a player has enough letters that they think they can solve The Puzzle, they must make their way to (or find) the puzzle room. One in the puzzle room, the player's collection of letters can be used to attempt to solve a Christmas-themed Wordle. Each time a player enters the puzzle room, they five attempts at the puzzle. If they don't solve the puzzle, any correct letters remains in the puzzle, making it easier for the next person to solve. Get the right letters and guess the right word first to get points!</dd>
			<dt>Escallation</dt><dd>Each time someone solves the puzzle, the next puzzle gets harder by one letter and the Minimum Bet (for dueling) increase by one letter. The board tiles are also refreshed and NPCs may spawn.</dd>

	Okay, things are starting to get a little complicated and there are more than a few rules. But have no fear! Read through the following Example Gameplay to get a feel for how the game works.

<h1>Example Gameplay</h1>
<p>
	At this point in the game, the players have moved around a bit, expanded the map, collected a 'hand' of three Spell Cards, and gathered a few Letters. Top of the round!
