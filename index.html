<h2>Overview: What is MMW?</h2>
	<p>
		Magic Mansion Wordle (MMW) is a *deep breath* Map Building, Deck Building, Wizard Dueling, Puzzle Game! <br>
		It sounds more complicated than it is. The main rules will be intuitive because MMW is based on three games:
		<ol>
			<li>Rock Paper Scissors (dueling system)</li>
			<li>Poker (betting system)</li>
			<li>Worldle (puzzle system)</li>
		</ol>
		First, let's get a handle on the big picture: <br>
		<dl>
			<dt>Overall Objective</dt><dd>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are gained by solving the puzzle, so the player who solves the puzzle the most times wins! (In the base game mode)</dd>
			<dt>Exploration and Resource Gathering</dt><dd>Players place down Map Tiles as they move around, building a unique map each game. Each room will have some (scrabble) Letters in it. Successfully Search rooms to gather letters and gain Spell Cards.</dd>
			<dt>Three Phases per Round</dt><dd>The game procedes in Rounds, with three phases per round: 
			<ol>
				<li>Movement Phase: All players select a Movement Card and reveal at the same time. Then all player tokens are moved accordingly.</li>
				<li>Action Phase: All players select an Action Card and reveal at the same time. There are four actions: Search, Duel, Puzzle, Move.</li>
				<li>Resolution Phase: Players resolve the actions they selected, either rolling to see what they find, attempting the puzzle, entering into a Wizard Duel, or moving an extra space. The only catch is that is any one player in a room chooses to Duel, all other actions are negated (including the Move action) and everyone is drawn into a duel. Once all actions have been completed, the next round begins!</li>
			</ol></dd>
			<dt>Dueling</dt><dd>If you find yourself in the same room as another player, watch out for Wizard Duels! Wizards (the players) duel using your hand of spell cards build up by exploring around the map. Each spell has a type (it's Rock Paper Scissors) and players will bet (like poker) on the outcome of the duel, using the letters you've collected from around the map.</dd>
			<dt>Puzzling</dt><dd>Once a player has enough letters that they think they can solve The Puzzle, they must make their way to (or find) the puzzle room. One in the puzzle room, the player's collection of letters can be used to attempt to solve a Christmas-themed Wordle. Each time a player enters the puzzle room, they have four attempts at the puzzle. If they don't solve the puzzle, any progress they may have made is saved and passed on to the next player, making it easier for the next person to solve. Get the right letters and guess the right word first to get points!</dd>
			<dt>Escallation</dt><dd>Each time someone solves the puzzle, the puzzle gets harder by one letter and the Minimum Bet (for dueling) increase by one letter. The board tiles are also refreshed and NPCs may spawn.</dd>
		</dl>
<br><br>
	Okay, things are starting to get a little complicated and there are more than a few rules. But have no fear! Read through the following Example Gameplay to get a feel for how the game works.

<h2>Example Gameplay</h2>

<h3>Example 1: Basic Duel</h3>
<h4>Note: Spell cards used in example are old versions and are subject to change</h4>
<p>
	Up to this point in the game, Ron and Harry have travelled around the map a bit, built up a 'hand' of spell cards and collected some letters. During the Movement Phase of the current round, Ron and Harry end up moving into the same room.<br>
	During the Action Phase, Harry chooses to <i>Search</i> and Ron chooses to <i>Duel</i>. The duel action cancels any other actions in that room. At the start of the duel, the player's have:
	<ul>
		<li>Harry</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Spell Cards:<br> <img src= "./images/avis.png" width = "175px" height = "100px"/>
				<img src= "./images/incendio.png" width = "175px" height = "100px"/>
			<img src= "./images/opugno.png" width = "175px" height = "100px"/></li>
			<li>Letter: 6</li>
			<li>Current HP: 5</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Ron</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Spell Cards: <img src= "./images/serpensortia.png" width = "175px" height = "100px"/>

		</ul>
	</ul>

<h2>Rules</h2>

	<p> <strong>Dueling Flowchart (version 2)</strong><br>
		<ol>
			<li>All players must add the Minium Bet number of letters into the pot.</li>
			<li>Any player can then bet, increasing the number of letters in the pot.</li>
			<li>As with poker, all players in the Duel must then Call, Raise, or Fold.</li>
				<dl><dt>Call</dt><dd>Match the amount of letters raised so you have added the same number of letters into the pot as the player who bet.</dd>
				<dt>Raise</dt><dd>Increase the size of the bet further.</dd>
				<dt>Fold</dt><dd>Leave the Duel, loosing the letters you have added to that point. Players cannot fold on the first round of the duel.</dd></dl>
			<li>All players then select a spell card from their hand and play them at the same time.</li>
			<li>For two-player duel, spells can either:</li>
				<dl><dt>Counter</dt><dd>The spells have the same Type {R-R, P-P, S-S}. In this case, the spell with the highest Speed value happens first, then the slower spell. If both spells have the same speed value, then neither spell effect happens.</dd>
				<dt>Parry</dt><dd>One spell's type beats the other {R-S, S-P, P-R}. Only the dominant spell's effect happens.</dd>
				<dt>Rare Spells</dt><dd>Some spells do not have Types (Ex. The Killing Curse). Follow the description of the spell card to determine the outcome. Rare spells are single-use spells and must be discarded after using.</dd></dl>
			<li>Resolve the outcome of each spell's effect when they are played. If a player is defeated (dropped to 0HP) before their spell effect happens (Countered by faster spell), then their spell does not happen.</li>
			<li>If two or more players are still alive and in the room (have not teleported), then the Duel continues for another round. All players then have an opportunity to raise and subsequentyl call or fold.</li>
			<li>There is only one winner of a duel (may be a team) and the pot is taken by the winner afte the end of the duel (not after each round).</li>
			<li><b>Duel end conditions:</b></li>
				<ul><li>All but one player (or team) has been defeated (0HP)</li>
				<li>All but one player (or team) has Folded</li>
				<li>All but one player (or team) has left the room (via teleportation or spell effect)</li></ul>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Dueling with Multiple Players and Teams</strong><br>
		<ol>
			<li>If any one player in a room chooses to duel, all players (and NPCs) in the room are drawn into a duel.</li>
			<li>Before placing their Minimum Bets, any number of players can choose to Team Up. Teams cannot be formed once the duel has started</li>
			<li>When on a team:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>All team members must place the Minumum Bet and Call all subsequent bets (including bets by their team member) to stay in the duel.</li>
					<li>All team members must play a spell card, but the team gets to then choose which spell to remain in play after seeing the other spells played.</li>
					<li>If any one member of a team takes damage, all members of the team must also take that damage. However, one team member can choose to take some or all of the damage that would have been taken by their comrade. (The team, as a collective, must take the full amount of damage).</li>
					<li>If one member of a team Dies, Folds, or is forced All In (and looses), the remaining team members may remain in the duel.</li>
					<li>If a team wins a duel, they can choose to divide the letters among the members as they please.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>When there are more than two players (or more than two teams) in a duel, all players reveal their spell cards at the same time. Once the teams have removed the spell card(s) they will not be using, the cards match up as follows:</li>
				<dl>
					<dt>All Counter</dt><dd>If all spells are the same, spell effects happen in order of speed. IF any two spells have the same speed, those spells do not happen. Spell damage is deal to all other players. Spell healing applies to all members of a team. Spell effects happen to all members of a team (one teleportation spells moves all members of the team).</dd>
					<dt>One Parry</dt><dd>If one spell dominates all the others, only that spell happens and affects all other players.</dd>
					<dt>Counter-Parry</dt><dd>If multiple spells are the dominant type and have different speeds, then only those spells happen and in order of their speeds.</dd>
					<dt>Counter-Cancel</dt><dd>If multiple spells are dominant, but have the same speed, then neither dominant spell happens and the remaining spells in play happen instead, according to the spell pairings.</dd>
				</dl>
			<li>Play continues until one of the end conditions is met.</li>

<h2>Solving the Puzzle</h2>		
<p>
	When a player feels like they have the letters they might need to solve the puzzle, they can make their way to the Puzzle Room and attempt to solve the puzzle.<br><br>
	To solve the puzzle:
	<ul>
		<li>When in the puzzle room, choose the Puzzle Action.</li>
		<li>If another player in the puzzle room chooses to duel, then the puzzle action is negated.</li>
		<li>If more than one player chooses the puzzle action, they can choose to either:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Solve the puzzle together (see Team Puzzling).</li>
			<li>Or start a duel.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>A player than has four guesses at the puzzle (on a laptop). They can only guess using the letters they have collected.</li>
		<li>Letters may be used multiple times in one word. If a player has an 'J', 'O', 'L', and 'Y' then they can guess 'Jolly' or 'Yolo' or 'Yoyo', etc.</li>
		<li>If the puzzle is solved in four attempts, then the player gains 1 point and is ejected from the puzzle room.</li>
		<li>If the puzzle is not solved in four attempts, the player is also ejected from the puzzle room.</li>
		<li>Upon being ejected, the player must discard all their letters and respawn in the Ballroom.</li>
		<li>Any progress made on the puzzle is saved, giving the next player a better chance of being able to solve it.</li>
	</ul>
Whenever the puzzle is solved:
<ul>
	<li>The player who solved it gains 1 point.</li>
	<li>The puzzle advances automatically, with each subsequent word being one letter longer.</li>
	<li>The board is refreshed:</li>
	<ul><li>Place the max number of letters on each letter space.</li>
	<li>Re-roll for NPCs on each NPC tile.</li>
	<li>Increase the Minimum Bet by 1 letter.</li></ul>
	<li>OPTION: Complete reset upon puzzle completion. All players return to their ballroom and all letters are discarded.</li>
</ul>
Team Puzzling: If more than one player chooses to attempt the puzzle at the same time, they can choose to solve it as a team.
<ul>
	<li>Both players' letters form a common pool of letters that can be used to solve the puzzle.</li>
	<li>Players must alternate inputting guesses.</li>
	<li>Only the player who enters in the correct guess gains the point.</li>
	<li>Only four guesses can be made collectively. </li>
	<li>If there are more than four players attempting the puzzle, then each player gets at least one guess.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Letter Exchange Room</h3>
In the letter exchange room, players can trade in three letters they have collected for a letter of their choice.<br>
This may be done any number of times.<br>
To exchange letters, choose the Puzzle Action in the LXCHANGE room.<br>
Any number of players can exchange letters at the same time without conflict.

<h2>Moving and Searching</h2>
<h3>Moving</h3>
<p>
	During the movement phase, all players reveal their choice of movement direction at the same time.<br>
	Movement directions are always relative to the orientation of the Ballroom tile.<br>
	<ul><caption>Players can choose to move in any direciton, as long as:</caption>
	<li>The current map tile has a door facing in that direction</li>
	<li>The map tile the player would move into has a door connected to a door on the current tile. (in other words, must move bewteen rooms at points where the doors connect).</li>
	</ul>
	If there is no map tile out a door, draw the top map tile from the pile and add one with the doors connecting.<br>
	After placing a new tile, fill in the letter spaces on the tile with letters, faced down.<br>
	If the tile has an NPC box on it, roll 1d6 to see if an NPC spaws:
	<ul>
		<li>1: Spawn a Hunter. Hunters will always move towards the nearest player and always choose to duel when applicable..</li>
		<li>2-5: Spawn a Normal NPC. Normal NPCs move randomly and always choose the duel action, when applicable.</li>
		<li>6: Spawn a Friend. Friendly NPCs will not attack, but will defend themselves. Friends move randomly.</li>
	</ul>
								
	If more than one player chooses to move in a direction that would add a map tile, work it out which way to place the drawn map tile.<br>
	If there are no more map tiles, then treat doors to the void as walls.<br><br>
	If a player chooses to Move an extra space as their move action, they may do so only if they are not in a room with someone who chose to duel. All players in the room are drawn into a duel, cancelling all other actions.							
</p>
<h3>Searching</h3>								
<p>
	Any room a player has moved into during the current round can be searched.<br>
	After playing the Search action card, roll 1d6:
	<ul>
		<li>1-2: Take one letter from the letters on the tile. If there are no more letters on the tile, you cannot gain letters from this search action.</li>
		<li>3-4: Take one letter from those on the tile and draw a Spell Card.</li>
		<li>5-6: Take two letters from the tile and draw a Spell Card.</li>
	</ul>
	If more than one player chooses to search the same room, but there are not enough letters for each player on the tile, then split the letters up evenly. (if it is not possible to split them evenly, then work something out. Maybe fight each other).							
</p>							</div>
								<br>
							<div class = "middle3">
<h2>Alternative Gamemodes</h2>
<h3>Playing with Teams</h3>
<p>
	If there are a large number of players, it may be best to start on two more teams of players.<br>
	Each team starts the game in their own Ballroom tile, placed a couple of map tile away from each other.<br>
	Team mates are automatically Teamed up at the start of any duels.
</p>
<h3>Playing against NPCs</h3>								
<p>
	There is also the option to play against the NPCs, trying to Solve the Puzzle as many times as you can before the NPCs hunt down all the player characters.
