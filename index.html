<h1>Overview: What is MMW?</h1>
	<p>
		Magic Mansion Worle (MMW) is a *deep breath* Map Building, Deck Building, Wizard Dueling, Puzzle Game! <br>
		It sounds more complicated than it is. The main rules will be intuitive because MMW is based on three games: <br>
		<ol>
			<li>Rock Paper Scissors (dueling system)</li>
			<li>Poker (betting system)</li>
			<li>Worldle (puzzle system)</li>
		</ol>
		First, let's get a handle on the big picture: <br>
		<dl>
			<dt>Overall Objective</dt><dd>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are gained by solving the puzzle, so the player who solves the puzzle the most times wins! (In the base game mode)</dd>
			<dt>Exploration and Resource Gathering</dt><dd>Players place down Map Tiles as they move around, building a unique map each game. Each room will have some Letters in it. Successfully Search rooms to gather letters and gain Spell Cards.</dd>
			<dt>Three Phases per Round</dt><dd>The game procedes in Rounds, with three phases per round: 
			<ol>
				<li>Movement Phase: All players select a Movement Card and reveal at the same time. Then all player tokens are moved accordingly.</li>
				<li>Action Phase: All players select an Action Card and reveal at the same time. There are three actions: Search, Duel, Puzzle. If two or more players are in the same room, and one player chooses to Duel, then everyone is drawn into the duel.</li>
				<li>Resolution Phase: Players resolve the actions they selected, either rolling to see what they find, attempting the puzzle, or entering into a Wizard Duel. Once all actions have been completed, the next round begins!</li>
			</ol></dd>
			<dt>Dueling</dt><dd>If you find yourself in the same room as another player, watch out for Wizard Duels! Wizards (you players) duel using the hand of spell cards build up and currated by exploring around the map. Each spell has a type (it's Rock Paper Scissors) and players will bet (like poker) on the outcome of the duel, using the letters you've collected from around the map.</dd>
			<dt>Puzzling</dt><dd>Once a player has enough letters that they think they can solve The Puzzle, they must make their way to (or find) the puzzle room. One in the puzzle room, the player's collection of letters can be used to attempt to solve a Christmas-themed Wordle. Each time a player enters the puzzle room, they five attempts at the puzzle. If they don't solve the puzzle, any correct letters remains in the puzzle, making it easier for the next person to solve. Get the right letters and guess the right word first to get points!</dd>
			<dt>Escallation</dt><dd>Each time someone solves the puzzle, the next puzzle gets harder by one letter and the Minimum Bet (for dueling) increase by one letter. The board tiles are also refreshed and NPCs may spawn.</dd>

	Okay, things are starting to get a little complicated and there are more than a few rules. But have no fear! Read through the following Example Gameplay to get a feel for how the game works.

<h1>Example Gameplay</h1>
<p>
	At this point in the game, the players have moved around a bit, expanded the map, collected a 'hand' of three Spell Cards, and gathered a few Letters. Top of the round!
</p>
	
<table border = "1", style = "text-align: center">
	<tr><td colspan="2">In the Movement Phase, both Harry and Ron reveal their Movement Cards. Harry selected 'Down' and Ron selected 'Up'. After they move their player token they find themselves in the same room.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>Action Phase: Selects 'Search'</td><td>Ron<br>Action Phase: Selects 'Duel'</td></tr>
	<tr ><td colspan = "2">Harry and Ron reveal their Action cards. Ron has chosen to duel! Both Harry and Ron are drawn into a Wizard Duel and Harry's Search action is negated.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>At the start of the Duel, Harry adds the Minimum Bet of 1 letter to the pot.</td><td>Ron<br>Ron also adds the Minimum Bet of 1 letter.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry</td><td>Ron<br> Neither Ron nor Harry choose to place a bet in the first round. Since Ron played Duel and Harry didn't, for the first round, Ron gains 'Control of Play' and will have to play their spell card first. Ron selects <i>Bombardo!</i>, which has the type 'Paper'.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>In their hand of spell cards, Harry has two Paper-type spells and a Snip(scissor)-type spell.<br>Harry plays the Snip Spell to Dominate Ron's spell.<br>Harry plays <i>Avis!</i></td>Ron<br></tr>
	<tr><td colspan = "2">Harry's Snip spell beats Ron's Paper spell, so only Harry's spell effect happens!<br>
	Ron takes 1d6 damage (Rolls to 2, Ron's down to 8 HP) and the Map Tiles gains a Hazardous Token (Area effect of the Avis spell).</tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>Now feeling lucky, Harry decides to Bet at the start of the second round.<br>
	Harry bets 2 letters</td><td>Ron<br>A little hurt, but determined to get Harry's letters, Ron Calls the bet and adds 2 letters to the pot.</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since Harry was the last to bet, Harry gains Control of Play and must play their spell first.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>Thinking that Ron might only have paper spells, Harry chooses to play <i>Sectumsempra!</i> which is paper-type.</td><td>Ron<br>Dang. Ron does only have paper-type spells, so they can't Dominate Harry's spell.<br>
	Not wanting to reveal the rest of their hand, Ron plays <i>Bombardo!</i></td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since both spells are of the type Paper, Ron's spell Counter's Harry's.<br>
	Neither spell effect happens and we move right to the next round.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry</td><td>Ron<br>Feeling confident, Ron bets another 2 letters this round. Ron only has 1 letter left!</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Harry<br>Seeing that Ron only has 1 more letter, Harry Raises to three letters, making it so Ron will have to go 'All In' to call!</b></td><td>Ron<br>Oh shoot. Ron doesn't want to go All In, so Ron Folds</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since Ron folded, Harry wins the pot and the duel ends.<br>
	Ron didn't want to go All In because if he did, he would only be able to play one more round, and if he didn't win on that round, he would be forced to fold anyway</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan = "2">Since they were involved in a Duel, both Ron and Harry gain the Manditory Movement condition and must move to another room next Round.<br>
	If They both happen to move to the same room, they could duel again!</td></tr>
